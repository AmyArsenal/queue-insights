Introduction

This Final System Impact Study (SIS) Report has been prepared in accordance with the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, Part VII, Subpart D, section 314 for New Service Requests (projects) in Transition Cycle 1 (TC1). The Project Developer/Eligible Customer (developer) is Amelia Energy Facility, LLC, and the Transmission Provider (TP) is PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). The interconnected Transmission Owner (TO) is Virginia Electric and Power Company (d/b/a Dominion Energy Virginia).

Preface

The Final System Impact Study is conducted on an aggregate basis within a New Services Request’s Cycle, and results are provided in both (i) a single Cycle summary format and (ii) an individual project-level basis. The Final System Impact Study Results (for both the summary and individual reports) will be publicly available on PJM’s website. Project Developers must obtain the results from the website.

In accordance with PJM Manual 14H, section 5, Final Agreement Negotiation Phase, the purpose of the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase is to:

Negotiate, execute and enter into the applicable final interconnection related service agreement found in Tariff, Part IX;
Conduct any remaining analyses or updated analyses based on New Service Requests withdrawn during Decision Point III (DP3); and
Adjust the security obligation based on New Service Requests withdrawn during Decision Point III and/or during the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase.
Retool 1:

In accordance with PJM Tariff Part VII.D 314 B(1)(a), Final Agreement Negotiation Phase:

PJM will perform a retool (Retool 1) after the conclusion of DP3 considering only the TC1 projects moving on in the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase (Removes DP3 withdrawals).
The Final System Impact Study reflecting results from the retooled analysis (Retool 1) will be publicly available on PJM’s website; Project Developers and Eligible Customers must obtain the results from the website.
PJM will provide updated final electronic agreements to Project Developers and Eligible Customers in the Cycle reflecting updates from the Final System Impact Study after Retool 1 including the adjusted Security requirements.
Retool 2 (if needed):

If particular New Service Requests do not sign their final agreements after receiving the updated information after Retool 1, there may be the need to run a second retool (Retool 2) to identify if any network upgrades are no longer necessary:

PJM will perform Retool 2 (if necessary) considering only the removal of TC1 projects from the model which chose not to execute their agreements after Retool 1.
The updated Final System Impact Study reflecting results from Retool 2 will be publicly available on PJM’s website; Project Developers and Eligible Customers must obtain the results from the website.
If there are any adjustments to the agreements required after Retool 2, the necessary network upgrade or Security changes will be handled via the scope change process post-GIA.

Definitions

Transmission Owner Interconnection Facilities: Facilities that are owned, controlled, operated and maintained by the Transmission Owner on the Transmission Owner’s side of the Point of Change of Ownership to the Point of Interconnection, including any modifications, additions or upgrades made to such facilities and equipment, that are necessary to physically and electrically interconnect the Generating Facility with the Transmission System or interconnected distribution facilities.

Stand Alone Network Upgrades: Network Upgrades, which are not part of an Affected System, which a Project Developer may construct without affecting day-to-day operations (e.g. taking a transmission outage) of the Transmission System during their construction.

Network Upgrades: Modifications or additions to transmission-related facilities that are integrated with and support the Transmission Provider’s overall Transmission System for the general benefit of all users of such Transmission System. Network Upgrades have no impact or potential impact on the Transmission System until the final tie-in is complete.

Notes

Note 1: PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT), Part VII, Subpart D, section 307.5 outlines cost allocation rules. The rules are further clarified in PJM Manual 14H, section 4.2.6. PJM shall identify the New Service Requests in the Cycle contributing to the need for the required Network Upgrades within the Cycle. All New Service Requests that contribute to the need for a Network Upgrade will receive cost allocation for that upgrade pursuant to each New Service Request’s contribution to the reliability violation identified on the transmission system in accordance with PJM Manuals.

Note 2: There will be no inter-Cycle cost allocation for Interconnection Facilities or Network Upgrades identified in the System Impact Study costs identified in a Cycle; all such costs shall be allocated to New Service Requests in that Cycle.

Note 3: For Project Developers with System Reinforcements listed: If this project presents cost allocation to a System Reinforcement indicates $0, then please be aware that as changes to the interconnection process occur, the cost responsibilities can change and a cost allocation may be assigned to this project. In addition, although this project presents cost allocation to a System Reinforcement is presently $0, this project may need this system reinforcement completed to be deliverable to the PJM system. If this project desires to come into service prior to completion of the system reinforcement, the Project Developer will need to request PJM to perform an interim deliverability study to determine if they would be deliverable for all or a portion of their output for each delivery year until the system reinforcement is complete.

Security Requirement

Per Tariff Part VII, Subpart D, section 314 (Final Agreement Negotiation Phase) A.1 and PJM Manual 14H, Section 5, if a Transition Cycle 1 New Service Request is withdrawn during Decision Point III and/or the Final Agreement Negotiation Phase, PJM shall remove the New Service Request from the Cycle and adjust the Security obligations of other New Service Requests based on the withdrawal. The Final System Impact Study results will reflect the updated Security amount for this project. Security may be in the form of cash, letter of credit, or other form of Security acceptable to PJM (see PJM M14H, Section 6.4).

Security is calculated for a New Service Request based on the Network Upgrade costs allocated pursuant to the Final System Impact Study results.

Note 1: "Network Upgrades" referred to in the calculation include both (i) the Physical Interconnection Network Upgrades and (ii) the System Reliability Network Upgrades as shown in the Cost Summary table.

Security Due for AF1-294/AF2-115/AG1-021

Security has been calculated for the AF1-294/AF2-115/AG1-021 project(s) based on the Final System Impact Study results and is shown in the table below. This Security must be provided at Final SIS through either a wire transfer or letter of credit or other form of Security deemed acceptable by PJM per Manual 14H, Section 6.4.

Note:

In accordance with Tariff, Part VII, Subpart D, section 314(B)(4)(a) (Final Agreement Negotiation Phase) failure to provide any required adjustments to Security within the 15 Business Day period will result in the New Service Request project being terminated and withdrawn.

Please see the cover letter for more details on Letter of Credit/Wire details to satisfy the additional Security requirement.

If no additional Security is required, please coordinate with your assigned Project Manager to initiate any refunds of Security reductions.

Transmission Owner Scope of Work

The New Service Request Project will interconnect with the Dominion transmission system via a new three breaker ring bus switching station that connects on the Jetersville-Ponton 115 kV Line 1007.   The required work for the interconnection of the New Service Request Project to the Dominion Transmission System is detailed in the following tables.

The total preliminary cost estimate for the Transmission Owner scope of work (including TOIF and Physical Interconnection Network Upgrades) is given in the table below. These costs do not include CIAC Tax Gross-up.

(No Transmission Owner Scope for this project.)

Developer Scope

Project Developer has elected the option Option to Build where they will assume responsibility for the design, procurement and construction of the Transmission Owner Interconnection Facilities and/or Stand-Alone Network Upgrades identified in this SIS report.

The Project Developer must fulfill additional requirements in accordance to PJM Manual 14C, section 5.1 and PJM Manual 14H, section 8.6.2.

The cost estimates for eligible facilities and Option to Build oversight are highlighted below:

Based on the scope of work for the Interconnection Facilities, it is expected to take 39 month(s) after the signing of a Generator Interconnection Agreement (as this is a FERC connection) and construction kickoff call to complete the installation of the physical connection work. This assumes that there will be no environmental issues with any of the new properties associated with this project, that there will be no delays in acquiring the necessary permits for implementing the defined interconnection work, and that all system outages will be allowed when requested.

Note that the TO findings were made from a conceptual review of this project. A more detailed review of the connection facilities and their cost will be identified in a future study phase. Further note that the cost estimate data provided should be considered high level estimates since it was produced without a detailed engineering review. The Project Developer will be responsible for the actual cost of construction. TO herein reserves the right to return to any issues in this document and, upon appropriate justification, request additional monies to complete any reinforcements to the transmission systems.

Remote Terminal Work: During Phase II of the PJM interconnection process, TO’s System Protection Engineering Department will review transmission line protection as well as anti-islanding required to accommodate the new generation and interconnection substation. System Protection Engineering will determine the minimal acceptable protection requirements to reliably interconnect the proposed generating facility with the transmission system. The review is based on maintaining system reliability by reviewing TO’s protection requirements with the known transmission system configuration which includes generating facilities in the area. This review may determine that transmission line protection and communication upgrades are required at remote substations.

Note 1: A Common Use Upgrade is a Network Upgrade that is needed for the interconnection of Generating Facilities or Merchant Transmission Facilities of more than one Project Developer or Eligible Customer and which is the shared responsibility of each Project Developer or Eligible Customer. If multiple Project Developers request to connect to the same interconnection substation, the Transmission Owner will determine the cost to accommodate all the requests at the substation. The cost for the interconnection will be allocated in proportion to the number of required terminations into the substation.

As shown in the oneline diagram, this Interconnection Request is sharing the Point of Interconnection and Interconnection Facilities with one or more other Interconnection Requests. Should other requests withdraw from Transition Cycle 1, the cost allocation for Transmission Owner Interconnection Facilities, Stand Alone Network Upgrades, and applicable Network Upgrades identified in the study report will be updated for the remaining project(s).

Transmission Owner Analysis

Summer Peak Analysis - Eliminated Flowgates
Summer Potential Congestion due to Local Energy Deliverability

PJM also studied the delivery of the energy portion of this interconnection request. Any problems identified below are likely to result in operational restrictions to the project under study. The developer can proceed with network upgrades to eliminate the operational restriction at their discretion by submitting an Upgrade Request into the New Service Request process.

Note: Only the most severely overloaded conditions are listed below. There is no guarantee of full delivery of energy for this project by fixing only the conditions listed in this section. With an Upgrade Request, a subsequent analysis will be performed which shall study all overload conditions associated with the overloaded element(s) identified.

The following flowgates remain after considering the topology reinforcements required by the cycle.

Summer Peak Analysis - Eliminated Flowgates
Winter Peak Analysis

PJM will start performing Winter Peak analysis in Transition Cycle 2.

Winter Potential Congestion due to Local Energy Deliverability

PJM will start performing Winter Peak analysis in Transition Cycle 2.

Light Load Analysis

The New Service Request AG1-021 was evaluated as a 20.0 MW injection in the Dominion area.

Note: The capacity portion of Generation Interconnection Requests are evaluated for single or N-1 contingencies. The full energy output of Generation Interconnection Requests are evaluated for multiple facility contingencies (double circuit tower line, fault with a stuck breaker, and bus fault).

(No impacts were found for this analysis)

Light Load Potential Congestion due to Local Energy Deliverability

PJM also studied the delivery of the energy portion of this interconnection request. Any problems identified below are likely to result in operational restrictions to the project under study. The developer can proceed with network upgrades to eliminate the operational restriction at their discretion by submitting an Upgrade Request into the New Service Request process.

(No impacts were found for this analysis)

Short Circuit Analysis

Based on PJM’s Short Circuit Analysis, this project did not contribute >1% fault duty to previously identified overdutied breakers, nor did it cause any new overdutied breakers.

Stability Analysis

Analysis Complete - No Issues

Executive Summary

This analysis is effectively a screening study to determine whether the addition of the Cluster 30 projects will meet the dynamics requirements of the NERC, Dominion Energy, and PJM reliability standards.

The load flow case for Phase 2 was used as a starting point and was updated based on latest Cluster 30 data, recommended transmission changes incorporated based on Dominion Energy Phase 2 feedback, and withdrawn generation removed. Cluster 30 projects have been dispatched online at maximum power output with near unity power factor measured at the high-side of the main substation transformer. The dynamic models for Cluster 30 projects were updated based on the latest DP2 data and include any tuning adjustments recommended during Phase 2.

Cluster 30 projects were tested for compliance with NERC, PJM, Transmission Owner and other applicable criteria. During the Phase 2 analysis contingencies were examined around the POIs and no violations were observed as a result of Cluster 30 projects interconnecting.  Due to this the Phase 3 analysis for Cluster 30 focused on the contingencies at Chase City that resulted in instability caused by Cluster 31 and Cluster 40 during Phase 2.  The Phase 3 analysis examined, 8 initial contingencies and 24 sensitivity contingencies were studied, each with a 30 second simulation time period. The studied contingencies included:

Three-phase faults with normal clearing time.
Single-phase bus faults with normal clearing time.
Single-phase faults with stuck breaker.

Instability was observed for contingencies when the Chase City to AG1-285 Tap 115 kV circuit was tripped. This outage resulted in instability due to insufficient export paths for the generation along the Farmville to Chase City 115 kV path through the radial connection.  Additionally, the Farmville to Chase City 115 kV path is prone to controller instability due to weak grid conditions determined by the composite short circuit ratio assessment.  The instability was caused by the Cluster 31 queue projects. 

To following mitigation was tested and all maintain stability:

Adding a new 115 kV line from AG1-285 to Butcher’s Creek.
Moving AF2-222 and AG1-285 to a new 230 kV line from Farmville to Finneywood.
Upgrade the new AG1-285 substation to a breaker and a half scheme to accommodate 2 x 230/115 kV transformers and a 230 kV line from AG1-285 to Finneywood .

The Transmission Owner has elected to upgrade the new AG1-285 substation to a breaker and a half scheme to accommodate 2 x 230/115 kV transformers and a 230 kV line from AG1-285 to Finneywood as the mitigation to the instability. This mitigation is required due to the interconnection of the Cluster 31 queue projects. Cluster 30 queue projects did not cause the instability. The mitigation was further tested for all Phase 2 contingencies and no violations were observed.

Nearby projects were found to trip based on their protection settings. The protection trip times were increased during Phase 2 analysis and maintained during the Phase 3 analysis:

AE1-056 tripped for frequencies below 55 hz for more than 0.001 seconds and the relay pick-up time was increased to 0.034 seconds
AE1-056 tripped for frequencies above 65 hz for more than 0.001 seconds and the relay pick-up time was increased to 0.020834 seconds
AF2-222 tripped for voltages above 1.3 p.u. for more than 0.001 seconds and the relay pick-up time was increased to 0.012501 seconds

With the mitigation identified above, the results of the contingencies tested on the RTEP 2027 summer peak case found:

Cluster 30 projects were able to ride through the faults (except for faults where protective action trips a generator(s)),
The system with Cluster 30 projects included is transiently stable and post-contingency oscillations were positively damped with a damping margin of at least 3% for inter area modes and 4% for local modes.
Following fault clearing, all bus voltages recovered to a minimum of 0.7 per unit after 2.5 seconds (except where protective action isolates that bus) and the final voltages are within the steady-state voltage ranges below per Dominion Energy’s transmission planning criteria.
P1 Category Contingencies:
0.93 to 1.05 p.u. for 230, 115, 69 kV facilities
0.93 to 1.03 p.u. for 138 kV facilities due to legacy switches
1.01 to 1.096 p.u. for 500 kV facilities
P2, P4, P5, and P7 Category Contingencies:
0.90 to 1.05 p.u. for 230, 115, 69 kV facilities
0.90 to 1.03 p.u. for 138 kV facilities due to legacy switches
1.00 to 1.096 p.u. for 500 kV facilities
No transmission element tripped, other than those either directly connected or designed to trip as a consequence of that fault.

No mitigation was needed to connect the Cluster 30 queue projects.

Reactive Power Analysis

The reactive power capability of AG1-021 meets the 0.95 leading and lagging PF requirement at the high side of the main transformer.

Steady-State Voltage Analysis

Steady State Voltage Analysis is Not Required.

PJM evaluated the impact of topology changing reinforcements to mitigate the impacts driven by New Service Requests. PJM determined which reinforcements were eliminated as a result of modeling the topology changing reinforcements. PJM then grouped the topology changing and eliminated reinforcements by region and computed a discount factor to apply to reinforcements to reduce the cost of all these reinforcements down to the cost of contstructing only the topology changing reinforcements.

Construct a new 230 kV line from the AG1-285 substation to the Finneywood 230 kV Substation. Expand AG1-285 substation and add two (2) new 230/115 kV transformers.
Description
n9630.0 addresses both stability and load flow violations. Construct a new 230 kV Line from the AG1-285 substation to the 230 kV Finneywood substation following the Line 1012 ROW for approximately 1.0 miles, then following the Line 556 ROW for approximately 3.5 miles to terminate at Finneywood. Expand the AG1-285 115 kV substation to accommodate two (2) new 115/230 kV transformers. Build a 230 kV substation at AG1-285 to connect the 115/230 kV transformers and the new 230 kV line to Finneywood. Expand the Finneywood 230 kV substation to accommodate the new line. The existing 1.0 miles of 115 kV from AG1-285 to Chase City does not need to be rebuilt to accommodate a new structure in the same right of way and therefore will be unchanged. The existing 3.5 miles of 500 kV towers from Structure 556/46 to Finneywood substation will need to be rebuilt as a double circuit tower to accommodate the new 230 kV line.

ContributorTopology Changing

Note: This topology changing reinforcement was developed by the transmission owner and modeled in PJM analysis to address cycle overload(s). A flowgate that this project contributed to was identified as requiring this topology reinforcement. Hence, this project is receiving a cost allocation based on its MW contribution to the need for this topology changing reinforcement but at a reduced amount considering the other reinforcements that were able to be eliminated. This project's cost allocation is based on the pro rata share of the MW impacts from all cost allocated contributors multiplied by the relevant regional discount factor listed in the executive summary report.
